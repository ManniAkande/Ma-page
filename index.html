          ⚫Hey and welcome to my page, for this page I tried to mess around with a lot of the css to create a website that looked almost passable <br/> I had some welp form some websites such as w3schools and animista to help make this webpage <br/> along with my brother Sam!
          
        </p>             
      </div>
      <p>
        ⚫For this Website I tend to use padding quite a bit to make my spacing for example between these paragraphs there is 100 pixel difference for spacing.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         ⚫I managed to figure out how to import fonts into the webpage with some help from my brother. From then on I made a quick wire frame design on MS paint to try and get a feel for how i wanted the website to look<br/>
        I then used a lot of text decoration to make the underlines for the nav bar up top aswell as setting the options to hover once you hover over them.              
      </p>
      
      <p>
        ⚫I used Animista to set up the fade in animation on the images on each slides they gave me code and all i had to do was add the class tag to the images i wanted to fade in.
